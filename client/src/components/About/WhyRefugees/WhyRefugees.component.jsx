        Why Refugees

        Bridging the gap between the untapped potential of refugees and the
        capital markets.
      </h3>

      <p className="p-theme-1">
        Today, nearly 70 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide –
        22 million of whom are refugees – the highest number in human history.
        Modern refugee crises are characterized by irregular, forced migration
        that is compounded by political and economic challenges like rising
        nationalism and slowdowns in job creation. Unfortunately, existing
        systems for short-term emergency response and productive integration
        have not kept up with these evolving trends and are both under-resourced
        and broken.
      </p>
      <p className="p-theme-1">
        The resulting dilemma represents the defining social crisis of our time
        and requires urgent, scalable, and economically sustainable solutions.
      </p>
      <p className="p-theme-1">
        While an increasing number of humanitarian efforts strive to create and
        expand economic growth for refugees in host countries, private investors
        and capital are often missing from the equation. Significant interest
        from across the capital continuum exists in the social and traditional
        investment community, but the investment landscape in forced migration
        settings remains highly fragmented: Bankable deals are few and far
        between.
      </p>
      <p className="p-theme-1">
        We see both an enormous need and opportunity to increase deal flow by
        working with groups from all sides – investors, governments, donors,
        host and refugee populations – to improve our understanding of how to
        navigate the investment climate and mitigate associated risks to capital
        and the targeted populations. We believe the best way to do this is by
        building a robust and enabled network of impact investors and other
        stakeholders who, working together, can unlock private capital that
        spurs growth, creates jobs, and leads to social and economic prosperity.
